# Python Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn Tutorial for Beginners

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement a machine learning model using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict passenger survival using various features, utilizing Scikit-Learn for model training and evaluation.

## Files
- `main.py`: The main Python script containing the machine learning workflow.
- `data.csv`: The Titanic dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Requirements
Make sure to have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
